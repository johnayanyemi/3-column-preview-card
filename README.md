## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learnt more about CSS Flexbox, as a beginner developer, Flexbox is one property I use often but this challenge really made me see it more, look at it in a different perspective. 

### Continued development

CSS Grids is one major property I'd like to dive into, I made this with Felxbox, but I know it can also be done with CSS Grids.

### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me a lot with learning Flexbox. I actually didn't know anything about the Flex property before playing the game, but I could do good thngs with it after I played the game. You should give it a try if you're hoping to learn the Flexbox.
